This Weather Forecast App uses a Weather API to display the weather by city. It offers a simple and user-friendly experience. Users can select a city and press the Enter key or click a button to view today's weather, including the city name, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

The app also shows a 7-day weather forecast with dates and weather icons. It is mobile-friendly — instead of scrolling down, users can scroll horizontally (left and right) to view the full weekly forecast.

Setting up the API was a bit challenging at first since there are so many options available. It was difficult to decide which API and which data options best suited my project.
However, I learned how powerful and convenient APIs are — you don't need to manually add all the data to display on the screen. Once the API is properly set up, it delivers the data directly to your project.
Overall, it was an interesting and fun project for me!😊
